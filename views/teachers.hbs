            <h2>How it works</h2>

            <p>We believe parents want to engage with their children about their school work but it isn't always easy for busy parents.</p>

            <p>SchoolTalk.org is a simple service to let you, the child's teacher, send short questions to subscribed parents to help them
                start a rewarding and engaging conversation with their child about the things they've been learning about at school.</p>

            <p>Send one question a day, or one a week, it's up to you.<p>

            <p>Start by creating a section for each class or year group.
                Then simply send questions to all parents subscribed to that group.</p>

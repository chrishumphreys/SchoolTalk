How many questions they set, and how often, is up to the teacher, so they may not have set any for your child’s class since you signed up.  If you want to double check that you’ve signed up to the right school and class, please email us at support@schooltalk.org.uk or use our contact page."

We’ll remove all your details from our records and you’ll no longer receive questions from schools or classes/groups you’ve signed up for."

Examples of questions sent using SchoolTalk are “How many continents are there?” and “What are the names of the primary colours?”  The teacher can include the answer and some keywords to help your conversation, like “Seven continents: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia” and “Red, blue and yellow.”"

The teacher can even include a weblink so that you can find out more about the subject yourself."

Once we’ve completed our trial and expand the service further, we’ll look again at funding but you can be sure we’ll never fund the service by selling any parent, teacher or school’s details."
